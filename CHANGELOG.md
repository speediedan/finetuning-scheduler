# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2.5.3] - 2025-08-14

### Added

- Verified support for Lightning ``2.5.2`` and ``2.5.3``

### Fixed

- Updated explicit pytorch version mapping matrix to include recent PyTorch release
- Fixed newly failing test dependent on deprecated Lightning class attribute. Resolved [#19](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/19).

### Changed

- For the examples extra, updated minimum `datasets` version to `4.0.0` to ensure the new API (especially important removal of `trust_remote_code`) is used.

## [2.5.1] - 2025-03-27

### Added

- Support for Lightning ``2.5.1``
- Added (multi)representer for ``PretrainedConfig`` object types

## [2.5.0] - 2024-12-20

### Added

- Support for Lightning and PyTorch ``2.5.0``
- FTS support for PyTorch's composable distributed (e.g. ``fully_shard``, ``checkpoint``) and Tensor Parallelism (TP) APIs
- Support for Lightning's ``ModelParallelStrategy``
- Experimental 'Auto' FSDP2 Plan Configuration feature, allowing application of the ``fully_shard`` API using module
name/pattern-based configuration instead of manually inspecting modules and applying the API in ``LightningModule.configure_model``
- FSDP2 'Auto' Plan Convenience Aliases, simplifying use of both composable and non-composable activation checkpointing APIs
- Flexible orchestration of advanced profiling combining multiple complementary PyTorch profilers with FTS ``MemProfiler``

### Fixed

- Added logic to more robustly condition depth-aligned checkpoint metadata updates to address edge-cases where `current_score` precisely equaled the `best_model_score` at multiple different depths. Resolved [#15](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/15).

### Deprecated

- As upstream PyTorch [has deprecated](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/138506) official Anaconda channel builds, `finetuning-scheduler` will no longer be releasing conda builds. Installation of FTS via pip (irrespective of the virtual environment used) is the recommended installation approach.
- removed support for PyTorch `2.1`

## [2.4.0] - 2024-08-15

### Added

- Support for Lightning and PyTorch ``2.4.0``
- Support for Python ``3.12``

### Changed

- Changed default value of the ``frozen_bn_track_running_stats`` option to the FTS callback constructor to ``True``.

### Deprecated

- removed support for PyTorch `2.0`
- removed support for Python `3.8`

## [2.3.3] - 2024-07-09

- Support for Lightning <= ``2.3.3`` (includes critical security fixes) and PyTorch <= ``2.3.1``

## [2.3.2] - 2024-07-08

- Support for Lightning <= ``2.3.2`` and PyTorch <= ``2.3.1``

## [2.3.0] - 2024-05-17

### Added

- Support for Lightning and PyTorch ``2.3.0``
- Introduced the ``frozen_bn_track_running_stats`` option to the FTS callback constructor, allowing the user to override the default Lightning behavior that disables ``track_running_stats`` when freezing BatchNorm layers. Resolves[#13](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/13).

### Deprecated

- removed support for PyTorch `1.13`

## [2.2.4] - 2024-05-04

### Added

- Support for Lightning ``2.2.4`` and PyTorch ``2.2.2``

## [2.2.1] - 2024-03-04

### Added

- Support for Lightning ``2.2.1``

## [2.2.0] - 2024-02-08

### Added

- Support for Lightning and PyTorch ``2.2.0``
- FTS now inspects any base `EarlyStopping` or `ModelCheckpoint` configuration passed in by the user and applies that configuration when instantiating the required FTS callback dependencies (i.e., `FTSEarlyStopping` or `FTSCheckpoint`). Part of the resolution to [#12](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/12).

### Changed

- updated reference to renamed `FSDPPrecision`
- increased `jsonargparse` minimum supported version to `4.26.1`

### Fixed

- Explicitly `rank_zero_only`-guarded `ScheduleImplMixin.save_schedule` and `ScheduleImplMixin.gen_ft_schedule`. Some codepaths were incorrectly invoking them from non-`rank_zero_only` guarded contexts. Resolved [#11](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/11).
- Added a note in the documentation indicating more clearly the behavior of FTS when no monitor metric configuration is provided. Part of the resolution to [#12](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/12).

### Deprecated

## [2.1.1] - 2023-11-08

### Added

- Support for Lightning ``2.1.1``


## [2.1.0] - 2023-10-12

### Added

- Support for Lightning and PyTorch ``2.1.0``
- Support for Python ``3.11``
- Support for simplified scheduled FSDP training with PyTorch >= ``2.1.0`` and ``use_orig_params`` set to ``True``
- Unified different FSDP `use_orig_params` mode code-paths to support saving/restoring full, consolidated OSD (PyTorch versions >= ``2.0.0``)
- added support for FSDP `activation_checkpointing_policy` and updated FSDP profiling examples accordingly
- added support for `CustomPolicy` and new implementation of `ModuleWrapPolicy` with FSDP `2.1.0`

### Changed

- FSDP profiling examples now use a patched version of ``FSDPStrategy`` to avoid https://github.com/omni-us/jsonargparse/issues/337 with ``jsonargparse`` < ``4.23.1``

### Fixed

- updated ``validate_min_wrap_condition`` to avoid overly restrictive validation in some ``use_orig_params`` contexts
- for PyTorch versions < 2.0, when using the FSDP strategy, disabled optimizer state saving/restoration per https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/pull/18296
- improved fsdp strategy adapter `no_decay` attribute handling

### Deprecated

- ``FSDPStrategyAdapter`` now uses the ``configure_model`` hook rather than the deprecated ``configure_sharded_model`` hook to apply the relevant model wrapping. See https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/pull/18004 for more context regarding ``configure_sharded_model`` deprecation.
- Dropped support for PyTorch ``1.11.x``.

## [2.0.9] - 2023-10-02

- Support for Lightning 2.0.8 and 2.0.9

## [2.0.7] - 2023-08-16

- Support for Lightning 2.0.7

## [2.0.6] - 2023-08-15

- Support for Lightning 2.0.5 and 2.0.6

## [2.0.4] - 2023-06-22

- Support for PyTorch Lightning 2.0.3 and 2.0.4
- adjusted default example log name
- disabled fsdp 1.x mixed precision tests temporarily until https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/pull/17807 is merged


## [2.0.2] - 2023-04-06

### Added

- Beta support for [optimizer reinitialization](https://finetuning-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/optimizer_reinitialization.html). Resolves [#6](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/6)
- Use structural typing for Fine-Tuning Scheduler supported optimizers with ``ParamGroupAddable``
- Support for ``jsonargparse`` version ``4.20.1``

### Changed

- During schedule phase transitions, the latest LR state will be restored before proceeding with the next phase configuration and execution (mostly relevant to lr scheduler and optimizer reinitialization but also improves configuration when restoring best checkpoints across multiple depths)

### Fixed

- Allow sharded optimizers ``ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`` to be properly reconfigured if necessary in the context of ``enforce_phase0_params`` set to ``True``.


## [2.0.1] - 2023-04-05

### Added

- Support for PyTorch Lightning 2.0.1
- Lightning support for ``use_orig_params`` via ([#16733](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/pull/16733))

## [2.0.0] - 2023-03-15

### Added

- Support for PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning 2.0.0!
- New ``enforce_phase0_params`` feature.  FTS ensures the optimizer configured in ``configure_optimizers`` will optimize the parameters (and only those parameters) scheduled to be optimized in phase ``0`` of the current fine-tuning schedule. ([#9](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/pull/9))
- Support for ``torch.compile``
- Support for numerous new FSDP options including preview support for some FSDP options coming soon to Lightning (e.g. ``use_orig_params``)
- When using FTS with FSDP, support the use of ``_FSDPPolicy`` ``auto_wrap_policy`` wrappers (new in PyTorch 2.0.0)
- Extensive testing for FSDP in many newly supported 2.x contexts (including 1.x FSDP compatibility multi-gpu tests)
- Support for strategies that do not have a canonical `strategy_name` but use `_strategy_flag`

### Changed

- Now that the core Lightning package is `lightning` rather than `pytorch-lightning`, Fine-Tuning Scheduler (FTS) by default depends upon the `lightning` package rather than the standalone `pytorch-lightning`. If you would like to continue to use FTS with the standalone `pytorch-lightning` package instead, you can still do so (see [README](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/blob/main/README.md)). Resolves ([#8](https://github.com/speediedan/finetuning-scheduler/issues/8)).
- Fine-Tuning Scheduler (FTS) major version numbers will align with the rest of the PyTorch ecosystem (e.g. FTS 2.x supports PyTorch and Lightning >= 2.0)
- Switched to use ``ruff`` instead of ``flake8`` for linting
- Replaced `fsdp_optim_view` with either `fsdp_optim_transform` or `fsdp_optim_inspect` depending on usage context because the transformation is now not always read-only
- Moved Lightning 1.x examples to `legacy` subfolder and created new FTS/Lightning 2.x examples in `stable` subfolder


### Removed

- Removed ``training_epoch_end`` and ``validation_epoch_end`` in accord with Lightning
- Removed `DP` strategy support in accord with Lightning
- Removed support for Python `3.7` and PyTorch `1.10` in accord with Lightning

### Fixed

- Adapted loop synchronization during training resume to upstream Lightning changes

## [0.4.1] - 2023-03-14

### Added

- Support for ``pytorch-lightning`` 1.9.4 (which may be the final Lightning 1.x release as PyTorch 2.0 will be released tomorrow)

## [0.4.0] - 2023-01-25

### Added

- **FSDP Scheduled Fine-Tuning** is now supported! [See the tutorial here.](https://finetuning-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/distributed/fsdp_scheduled_fine_tuning.html)
- Introduced [``StrategyAdapter``](https://finetuning-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/finetuning_scheduler.strategy_adapters.html#finetuning_scheduler.strategy_adapters.StrategyAdapter)s. If you want to extend Fine-Tuning Scheduler (FTS) to use a custom, currently unsupported strategy or override current FTS behavior in the context of a given training strategy, subclassing ``StrategyAdapter`` is now a way to do so. See [``FSDPStrategyAdapter``](https://finetuning-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/finetuning_scheduler.strategy_adapters.html#finetuning_scheduler.strategy_adapters.FSDPStrategyAdapter) for an example implementation.
- support for `pytorch-lightning` 1.9.0

### Changed

- decomposed ``add_optimizer_groups`` to accommodate the corner case where FTS is being used without an lr scheduler configuration, also cleanup unrequired example testing warning exceptions
- updated the fts repo issue template


### Fixed

- removed PATH adjustments that are no longer necessary due to https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/pull/15485

### Removed

- removed references to the ``finetuning-scheduler`` conda-forge package (at least temporarily) due to the current unavailability of upstream dependencies (i.e. the [pytorch-lightning conda-forge package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytorch-lightning/files) ). Installation of FTS via pip within a conda env is the recommended installation approach (both in the interim and in general).
