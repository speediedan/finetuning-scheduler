# If you're experiencing issues with not seeing comments when clicking on a file from the GitHub Pull Request extension view in Visual Studio Code, try the following steps:

1. **Refresh the Pull Request View**: Sometimes, the view may not update automatically. Refresh the GitHub Pull Request extension view to see if the comments appear.

2. **Check for Updates**: Ensure that both Visual Studio Code and the GitHub Pull Request extension are up to date. Updates often fix bugs and improve functionality.

3. **Reload Window**: You can reload the Visual Studio Code window by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Reload Window`. This can help in refreshing the extension's state.

4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to view comments on the pull request. If you're not the author or a reviewer, you might have limited access.

5. **Inspect the Output Panel**: Open the Output panel (`View > Output`) and select `GitHub Pull Requests` from the dropdown. Look for any error messages that might indicate what’s going wrong.

6. **Disable Other Extensions**: Sometimes, other extensions can interfere with the GitHub Pull Request extension. Try disabling other extensions to see if that resolves the issue.

7. **Reinstall the Extension**: If none of the above steps work, consider uninstalling and reinstalling the GitHub Pull Request extension.

8. **Check GitHub Status**: Occasionally, GitHub services may experience outages. Check the [GitHub Status page](https://www.githubstatus.com/) to see if there are any ongoing issues.

If the problem persists after trying these steps, consider reaching out to the extension's support or checking their GitHub repository for similar issues reported by other users.
