# PyTorch prerelease override for UV_OVERRIDE
# Generated by lock_ci_requirements.sh from torch-pre.txt
#
# Manual installation with prerelease (two-step approach for security):
#   Step 1: Install PyTorch prerelease (edit torch-pre.txt to configure channel)
#   uv pip install --prerelease=if-necessary-or-explicit torch==2.10.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
#
#   Step 2: Install FTS with Lightning commit pin (torch already installed, will be skipped)
#   export UV_OVERRIDE=${PWD}/requirements/ci/overrides.txt
#   uv pip install -e ".[all]"
#
# Or with locked requirements:
#   uv pip install --prerelease=if-necessary-or-explicit torch==2.10.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
#   UV_OVERRIDE=${PWD}/requirements/ci/overrides.txt uv pip install -e . -r requirements/ci/requirements.txt

torch==2.10.0
